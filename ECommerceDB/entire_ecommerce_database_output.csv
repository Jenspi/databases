"P02",1,4,"Almost new—cover is a bit dirty/bent but bought new. Good authentic book though"
"P02",2,5,"It's a great book for college level database courses."
"P02",3,5,"This textbook is getting me through my databases study unit at University without it I'd be lost. The book is well organised and the explanations are clear with many examples and diagrams. The shipping time was incredible."
"P02",4,5,"Great book. Refined and improved."
"P03",1,5,"Having had beignets in New Orleans I was looking to replicate at home. This mix is legit! My kids beg me to make it every weekend. As long as you follow the sirectuons to a T they turn out perfect."
"P03",2,5,"Easy to make but you need to use a lot of flour rolling out since the dough is very sticky when mixed. Don't roll too thin or will not get puffy like they are at the Cafe."
"P03",3,5,"The mix is great. Have bought it many times either online or straight from Cafe' Du Monde. Love the cafe."
"P05",1,5,"The only hot sauce my family wants."
"P05",2,1,"Love the hot sauce but 1 of the bottles was broken and I can't put in to replace it. So idk what to do about it being broken."
"P05",3,1,"This was crystal original hot sauce. Not extra hot as written in the description"
"P05",4,5,"I'd say that this is my #2 hot sauce right behind OG Tabasco. I don't think you can ever go wrong it. Tangy but not fiery."
"P05",5,5,"This is the best Louisiana style hot sauce ever great price large bottles don't even think about it so good"
